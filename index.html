        <p>This is a repository for the entire mockspec pipeline that uses functional forms
of the python code. </p>

<p>To run this code, the following python packgages need to be installed:
    numpy
    pytables
    pandas</p>

<p>Overview:</p>

<pre><code>This code generates synthetic quasar absorption lines by running lines of sight (LOS) 
through a simulated galaxy made with ART.  This repository has all the code required
to generate and analyze the spectra. 
</code></pre>

<p>Before you run the code:</p>

<pre><code>There are a few steps that need to be taken before the code can be run. 

1) Get the simulation in the correct format. ART output the entire simulation box, 
   typicaly 10Mpc along a side. Mockspec does not run on these boxes. It instead
   runs on a small box selected from the large box. This selection is done using 
   ANA, a code written by Daniel Ceverino and greatly imporved by Kenza Arraki. 
   It is found in funcs/ana/. Running ANA can be challenging. It reuires the 
   following simulation files:
        10MpcBox_HartGal_csf_a0.300.di
        10MpcBox_HartGal_csf.d
        PMcrda0.300.DAT
        PMcrs0a0.300.DAT    
        sf.dat

    To control the run of ANA, there are two control file: 
        control.dat 
        schedule_R.dat

    Schedule_R.dat has most of the controls in it. The top section has flags as
    to what the code should read in and what files it should produce. The sections 
    that definately need to have a 1 are:
        Read N-body file
        Read stellar file
        Read HYDRO file
        Set units and global variables
        Find halo center using particle distribution
        Compute angular momentum
        density, temperature, entropy profiles and Rvir calculation
        Binary file with gas cells inside 4Rvir-box
        Binary file with gas cells inside 4Rvir-box (metalliciites)
    Most of the rest of the file should not be touched. 
    ANA has an interesting behaviour where it finds the center of the galaxy, but
    is super bad at it. You need to find the center with Rockstar and put it in 
    manually. The coordinates are put in on the lines "xuser", "yuser", "zuser". 
    The flag in front of "ioptCenter=1/2/3--&gt;potential/HF/IFRIT" should be 
    set to 1, indicating the center is from a halo finder.

    To setup control.dat, only change after the three repeated lines of "1. 129". 
    The single number on the next line is the number of snapshots to run ANA on.
    Leave this as one. The rest of the file is the list of expansion parameters
    of the snapshots. Even if there are several numbers listed here, ANA will only 
    run on the first one, since the number of snapshots to run is set to 1. 

    Once both control.dat and schedule_R.dat are set, run ana.R.exe
    The file needed is the GZ file. 

2) The pipeline does not run on the binary files. It runs on an ASCII version 
    of the file. To convert, use readbinary.exe. Run it with the format of 

        readbinary.exe &lt;binary file&gt; &lt;name of output ASCII file&gt; GZ

    The name of the output ASCII file should be the name of the binary file,
    but with .dat replaced with .txt


3) Configure the run. The parameters of the run are set in the mockspec.config 
   file. There are three sections in this file. The first describes the 
   galaxy and basic code parameters.  These are mostly self-explanatory. The
   number of cores only affects the codes that can be run with parallization,
   namely cellfinder. The root location is not used by anything, so don't change it

   The second section determines which codes will be run. A 1 turns the code on, 
   a 0 turns it off. 

   The third section describes the ions to be probed and what instrument will be
   used for that ion. 


4) Ensure the directory has all required files, namely the galaxy file 

5) Make all compiled codes. This includes: rates, cellfinder, los7, specsynth, 
   sysabs, and cullabs. To make rates, you need to download and untar the follwing files:
        http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/jrvander/ratesFiles/coolingtables.tar.gz
        http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/jrvander/ratesFiles/lapack.tar.gz
        http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/jrvander/ratesFiles/slatec.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Running the code:
    The main driver is mockspec.py. Run this in the directory with the snapshot.<br>
    The final output is the ALL sysabs  </p>
