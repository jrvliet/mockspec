Hi Chris,

Daniel had originally given me SEDs for a stellar population of 10^3 solar masses at
two metallicities: Solar and 0.004Solar.   When I generated a grid of models, the
fluxes were scaled to create SEDs for solar masses of 10^4,10^5, and 10^6 solar
masses.  I have each population at 5 different ages: 1,5,10,20, and 40 Myr

The original units were L_lambda.  That is, the wavelength is in Angstroms and the
luminosity is given in ergs/s/Angstrom.  I also have these files in L_nu units as
well.  

A list of original (non-scaled) output from Starburst99 is:

10^3 solar masses, solar metallicity:
wavelength=Angstroms, log(L_lambda)=log(ergs/s/Angstrom)

Ms3_1Myr.stb99
Ms3_5Myr.stb99
Ms3_10Myr.stb99
Ms3_20Myr.stb99
Ms3_40Myr.stb99

10^3 solar masses, 0.004solar metallicity:
wavelength=Angstroms, log(L_lambda)=log(ergs/s/Angstrom)

Ms3_0d004m_1Myr.stb99
Ms3_0d004m_5Myr.stb99
Ms3_0d004m_10Myr.stb99
Ms3_0d004m_20Myr.stb99
Ms3_0d004m_40Myr.stb99

If you want to look at these files, they live at:
