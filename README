This is a repository for the entire mockspec pipeline that uses functional forms
of the python code. 

To run this code, the following python packgages need to be installed:
    numpy
    pytables
    pandas


Overview:

    This code generates synthetic quasar absorption lines by running lines of sight (LOS) 
    through a simulated galaxy made with ART.  This repository has all the code required
    to generate and analyze the spectra. 


Before you run the code:
    
    There are a few steps that need to be taken before the code can be run. 

    1) Get the simulation in the correct format. ART output the entire simulation box, 
       typicaly 10Mpc along a side. Mockspec does not run on these boxes. It instead
       runs on a small box selected from the large box. This selection is done using 
       ANA, a code written by Daniel Ceverino and greatly imporved by Kenza Arraki. 
       It is found in funcs/ana/. Running ANA can be challenging. It reuires the 
       following simulation files:
            10MpcBox_HartGal_csf_a0.300.di
            10MpcBox_HartGal_csf.d
            PMcrda0.300.DAT
            PMcrs0a0.300.DAT    
            sf.dat
